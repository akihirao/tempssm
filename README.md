# tempssm

`tempssm` provides a practical R interface for state-space analysis of
temperature time series. The package focuses on linear Gaussian state-space
models estimated by Kalman filtering and smoothing, using the `KFAS` package
as the computational backend (Helske, 2017).

## Key Features

- Fits linear Gaussian state-space models to temperature time series.
- Represents temperature dynamics using interpretable latent components:
  level, seasonal variation, autoregressive structure, and optional
  exogenous effects.
- Supports arbitrary integer seasonal frequencies, while the current examples
  and validation focus primarily on monthly temperature data.
- Allows the autoregressive order to be specified by the user.
- Provides S3 methods for summaries, diagnostics, accessors, and plots.
- Includes time-series cross-validation tools for model evaluation.

## Prior Art and Scope

`tempssm` provides a domain-focused workflow for analyzing temperature time
series with linear Gaussian state-space models. It brings together model
construction, component extraction, uncertainty summaries, residual
diagnostics, visualization, and time-series cross-validation in a single R
package interface tailored to temperature applications.

The package builds on established statistical methodology, including linear
Gaussian state-space modeling, Kalman filtering, and Kalman smoothing. Model
estimation is handled through the `KFAS` package, which provides a general
framework for state-space models in R.

The initial implementation was adapted from the supplementary code provided by
Baba (2024), accompanying Baba et al. (2024), which analyzed sea temperature
trends using a linear Gaussian state-space model. The supplementary code is
publicly available at:

<https://github.com/logics-of-blue/sea-temperature-trend-jogashima>

Compared with that prior implementation, `tempssm` extends the workflow into a
reusable R package interface with input validation, documented S3 methods,
tests, diagnostics, cross-validation utilities, and examples for broader
temperature time-series analysis.

## Basic Usage

### Load the Package and Example Data

This example uses monthly sea surface temperature (SST) data off Niigata,
Japan, from February 2002 to December 2023.

```r
library(tempssm)
data(niigata_sst)
```

### Fit a State-Space Model

The function `tempssm()` fits a linear Gaussian state-space model to a
temperature time series.

```r
res <- tempssm(niigata_sst)
```

The returned object is an S3 object of class `"tempssm"`. Results can be
inspected with standard methods.

```r
summary(res)
plot(res)
```

The panels show the estimated model components; gray ribbons indicate
pointwise 95% confidence intervals.

In this example, the estimated level component suggests a gradual increase
in SST, with an average annual increase of approximately 0.05 °C.

The ggplot2-style interface is also available:

```r
autoplot(res)
```

By default, `plot(res)` and `autoplot(res)` produce the same component plot.

### Use Your Own Data

If you already have a `ts` object, pass it directly to `tempssm()`.

```r
res <- tempssm(my_ts)
```

For monthly temperature data stored in a CSV file, prepare columns named
`Year`, `Month`, and `Temp`.

```text
Year,Month,Temp
2010,8,13.6
2010,9,6.8
2010,10,NA
2010,11,-1.4
...
```

Use `NA` for missing temperature values, and keep the corresponding `Year` and
`Month` entries. The CSV file should be comma-separated and UTF-8 encoded.

```r
my_ts <- tempssm::read_monthly_temp_ts("temperature.csv")
res <- tempssm(my_ts)
```

`read_monthly_temp_ts()` uses base R's `ts()` representation internally. You
can also construct a `ts` object manually if finer control is needed.
