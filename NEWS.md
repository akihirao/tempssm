# tempssm 0.2.5

* Added a `marginal` option to select diffuse or marginal likelihood
  consistently during KFAS model fitting, likelihood evaluation, summaries,
  information criteria, and time-series cross-validation.
* Extended the component accessors to return either smoothed or filtered state
  estimates. Filtered confidence intervals are available, with estimates and
  intervals during the exact diffuse phase reported as `NA`.
* Added `compare_tempssm_aic()` for validated AIC comparison across fitted
  models using the same response data and likelihood type.
* Added `predict.tempssm()` for forecasts beyond the sample period, including
  models supplied with explicit future exogenous values. An explicit
  `exo_strategy = "last"` option provides a simplified one-step persistence
  forecast using the final observed exogenous values.
* Classified model-fitting messages by verbosity so routine progress details
  can be controlled with `options(tempssm.verbosity = ...)` or the
  `TEMPSSM_VERBOSITY` environment variable.
* Added a pkgdown site workflow, renamed the introductory vignette to
  `getting-started`, and updated package documentation and links.
* Refactored model fitting, cross-validation, forecasting, plotting, and
  time-series utilities into focused internal helpers, with expanded contract
  and regression tests.
* Changed `autoplot.tempssm()` to return a reusable faceted `ggplot` for one to
  four selected model components, and re-exported the `autoplot()` generic.

# tempssm 0.2.4

* Updated package authorship metadata and related documentation to reflect the
  current contributor and co-author list.
* Added rOpenSci statistical software standards documentation and supporting
  tests for parameter recovery, edge cases, noise susceptibility, and extended
  test workflows.
* Clarified missing-value handling for temperature responses and exogenous
  covariates.

# tempssm 0.2.3.1

* Removed several package dependencies by replacing small helper uses with
  local implementations.
* Replaced patchwork-based `autoplot.tempssm()` composition with an internal
  gtable layout helper.


# tempssm 0.2.2

* Major update of core function tempssm().


# tempssm 0.2.1

* The package was previously named `ThermoSSM` and has been renamed to
  `tempssm`.
* Generalized the seasonal component to support models with or without
  seasonality.
